  <p><strong>üéØ Goal:</strong> Be the first to create two sequences of five tokens in a row ‚Äî vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.</p>

  <p><strong>üß© Game Overview:</strong> The board is made up of playing cards (each appears twice). You‚Äôre dealt a hand of 7 cards, and on your turn, you play one to place a token on a matching space on the board.</p>

  <p><strong>üïπÔ∏è Turn Instructions:</strong> On your turn, select a card from your hand and click its matching card on the board to place your token. You'll automatically draw a new card after playing.</p>

  <p><strong>üÉè Wild Cards ‚Äì Jacks:</strong> 
    <br />‚Ä¢ Two-Eyed Jacks: Place a token anywhere on the board.
    <br />‚Ä¢ One-Eyed Jacks: Remove an opponent‚Äôs token from the board.
  </p>

  <p><strong>üß± Corner Cards:</strong> The four corners are wild. They are always occupied and count toward everyone‚Äôs sequences. You do not need a card to use them.</p>

  <p><strong>üèÜ Winning the Game:</strong> A sequence is five tokens in a straight line. The first player or team to make two sequences wins. Sequences can overlap by one token.</p>

  <p><strong>üß† Strategy Tips:</strong> 
    <br />‚Ä¢ Block opponents from completing sequences. 
    <br />‚Ä¢ Use one-eyed Jacks to disrupt them. 
    <br />‚Ä¢ Save two-eyed Jacks for tight situations or to finish a sequence.
