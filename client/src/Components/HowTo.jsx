            <strong>üéØ Goal:</strong> Be the first to create two sequences of
            five tokens in a row ‚Äî vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>üß© Game Overview:</strong> The board is made up of playing
            cards (each appears twice). You‚Äôre dealt a hand of 7 cards, and on
            your turn, you play one to place a token on a matching space on the
            board.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>üïπÔ∏è Turn Instructions:</strong> On your turn, select a card
            from your hand and click its matching card on the board to place
            your token. You'll automatically draw a new card after playing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>üÉè Wild Cards ‚Äì Jacks:</strong>
            <br />
            ‚Ä¢ Two-Eyed Jacks: Place a token anywhere on the board.
            <br />‚Ä¢ One-Eyed Jacks: Remove an opponent‚Äôs token from the board.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>üß± Corner Cards:</strong> The four corners are wild. They
            are always occupied and count toward everyone‚Äôs sequences. You do
            not need a card to use them.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>üèÜ Winning the Game:</strong> A sequence is five tokens in a
            straight line. The first player or team to make two sequences wins.
            Sequences can overlap by one token.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>üß† Strategy Tips:</strong>
            <br />
            ‚Ä¢ Block opponents from completing sequences.
            <br />
            ‚Ä¢ Use one-eyed Jacks to disrupt them.
            <br />‚Ä¢ Save two-eyed Jacks for tight situations or to finish a
            sequence.
